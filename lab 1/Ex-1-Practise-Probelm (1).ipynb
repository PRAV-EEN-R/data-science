        "#As a data scientist, the first step in any project is to collect relevant and structured data. In this exercise, your task is to extract job-related information from the RemoteOK job website: [https://remoteok.com/r](https://remoteok.com/r).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Objectives:\n",
        "#- Collect the following data fields for each job posting:\n",
        " # - **Company Name**\n",
        "  #- **Job Role**\n",
        "  #- **Location**\n",
        "  #- **Features or Tags** (e.g., technologies, benefits, job type)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🛠 Instructions:\n",
        "#- Use Python along with libraries such as `requests`, `pandas`, and optionally `json` or `BeautifulSoup` if needed.\n",
        "#- Retrieve the job data from the RemoteOK API or web page.\n",
        "#- Parse the JSON or HTML response to extract the required fields.\n",
        "#- Store the collected data in a structured format such as **CSV** for future analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📦 Output:\n",
        "#A CSV file (e.g., `remoteok_jobs.csv`) containing all extracted job listings with the specified fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "#> ✅ This dataset will serve as the foundation for further data analysis and machine learning tasks in upcoming lab exercises.\n"
